      <p>
        bell hooks explored love, race, and gender as tools for social transformation.
        She believed love was an act of will — a daily choice that connects healing with justice.
        Her work bridges emotion and intellect, asking us to practice love as freedom.
      </p>
       <p>
    For hooks, love was not a mere emotion but a conscious act of resistance —  
    a way to unlearn domination and nurture care.  
    In <em>All About Love</em>, she redefines love as “the will to extend oneself  
    for the purpose of nurturing one’s own or another’s spiritual growth.”
  </p>
   <p>
    She criticized how modern culture equates love with control or possession,  
    reminding us that real love cannot exist without justice.  
    Her writing turns love into an ethical practice — one that demands clarity, boundaries, and truth-telling.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through her essays, hooks shows that love is both personal and political.  
    To love fully, we must confront fear, nurture community, and reclaim tenderness  
    as a source of strength.  
    In this way, she invites us to make love a daily practice of freedom.

      <div class="details">1900–1980<br>German Psychologist, Philosopher</div>
    </div>
    <div class="desc">
      <div class="title"><em>Is Love an Art?</em></div>
      <p>
        Erich Fromm viewed love as a discipline — a creative practice that must be learned, not merely felt.
        In <em>The Art of Loving (1956)</em>, he wrote that love demands care, responsibility, respect, and knowledge.
        These qualities transform affection into maturity and connect emotion with understanding.
      </p>
       <p>
    Fromm believed that love was not something we fall into,  
    but something we build through effort and awareness.  
    Like any art, it requires practice — patience, humility, and the courage to give without expecting return.
  </p>

  <p>
    He argued that the modern world confuses comfort with connection.  
    In a society driven by consumption and loneliness,  
    love becomes an act of resistance — a way to reclaim our capacity for empathy and presence.
  </p>

  <p>
    To love, for Fromm, is to choose life over habit, care over indifference.  
    It begins with self-knowledge and expands outward,  
    transforming not only our relationships but the very way we exist with others.  
    Love, in this sense, is a lifelong art — one that must be practiced every day.

    </div>

      <div class="title"><em>Each Time You Love</em></div>
      <p>
        Audre Lorde described herself as “Black, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet.”  
        She saw identity as a source of power — and difference as a bridge to connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        In essays like <em>The Uses of the Erotic</em> and <em>The Master’s Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master’s House</em>,  
        Lorde redefined the erotic as a force of joy, creativity, and resistance.  
        For her, speaking truth — even when painful — was an act of radical self-love.
      </p>
     <p>
    “Each time you love, love as deeply as if it were forever,” she wrote.  
    In that act of loving, Lorde found both defiance and renewal —  
    proof that tenderness can be a form of survival,  
    and that love, practiced honestly, is a form of revolution.
